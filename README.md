  ## description:
  The purpose behind this project was to create a generator for README's. That way developing README's can be done with ease. Also now I can be prompted with everything I need in my read me, so I do not forget anything. Which often can happen. 

  ## instructions:
  None at the moment.

  ## usage:
  n/a
 
  ## credits:
  None, at the moment but here's a useful link on how to develop high quality README's that was provided to me by my instructor:
  https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide
  I utilized https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba to generate markdown license badges.
